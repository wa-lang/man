## 1.1. hello world

Printing "hello world" is a common example for PL. The Wa-lang example prints "你好，凹语言！" in Chinese, means "Hello, Wa-lang".

### 1.1.1 你好，凹语言！

Create hello.wa file with the following content:

```wa
// 版权 @2019 凹语言 作者。保留所有权利。

import "fmt"
import "runtime"

global year: i32 = 2023

func main {
    println("你好，凹语言！", runtime.WAOS)
    println(add(40, 2), year)

    fmt.Println("1+1 =", 1+1)
}

func add(a: i32, b: i32) => i32 {
    return a+b
}
```

Among them, `//` starts with a line comment, the `import` keyword imports two packages of the standard library, and the `global` keyword defines a global variable and gives an initial value of 2023. The `func` keyword defines the `main` function and the `add` function. The `main` function is the entry point of the program, which prints "你好，凹语言！" through the built-in `println` function, while using the `Println` string and integer expression results of the `fmt` package. The global `year` variable is also used in the `main` function. In addition, the `add` function is called and the return value is printed. The `add` function has 2 input parameters and a return value.

If the `wa` command of the Wa-lang has been installed locally (refer to Section 1.2 for the installation), you can enter the following command to execute:

```
$ wa run hello.wa 
你好，凹语言！ wasi
42
1+1 = 2
```

### 1.1.2 Playground online

The Wa-lang is a general-purpose programming language designed for WebAssembly. From its inception, the browser has been the first support target. Playground can be accessed through [https://wa-lang.org/playground](https://wa-lang.org/playground). The interface is as follows:

Click the "RUN" button to see the output results.

Known issues:
- The online playground only supports single file mode and does not support multi-file project mode yet. This problem does not affect syntax compatibility. Subsequent corrections to this problem will not affect the existing source code. Developers using Wa-lang do not need to deal with this issue specially.
