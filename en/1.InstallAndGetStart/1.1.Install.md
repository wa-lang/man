## 1.1. Install Wa-lang Compiler

In addition to accessing the online Wa-lang playground, you can also install the compiler locally.

### 1.1.1 Install binaries

Download the latest binaries from Github: [https://github.com/wa-lang/wa/releases](https://github.com/wa-lang/wa/releases). You need to ensure that it corresponds to the local platform. For example, on macOS/amd64, [wa_0.8.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz](https://github.com/wa-lang/wa/releases/download/v0.8.1/wa_0.8.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz) should be used.

The contents of the directory after decompression are as follows:

```
$ tree ./wa_0.8.1_darwin_amd64
./wa_0.8.1_darwin_amd64
├── LICENSE
├── README-zh.md
├── README.md
└── wa

1 directory, 5 files
```

Add the directory path to the system's `PATH` environment, then reopen the command line environment and execute the `wa -v` command to view the version information.

```
$ wa -v
Wa version v0.8.1
```

The first time you execute the `wa` command, a `wa.wat2wasm.exe` command will be generated in the same directory as the command.

The installation is now completed.

### 1.1.2 Install from source code

Installing from source requires installing Go1.17+ version, then execute the following command to install the latest Wa-lang compiler:

```
go install wa-lang.org/wa
```

It will be installed to the `$HOME/go/bin` directory by default, so this directory path needs to be added to the system's `PATH` environment.
Then reopen the command line environment and execute the `wa` command once, the same help information as above will be output.

The first time you execute the `wa -v` command to view version information, a `wa.wat2wasm.exe` command will be generated in the same directory as the command.

The installation work is now completed.

### 1.1.3 Homebrew (MacOS & Linux)

For macOS and Linux systems, it can also be installed through Homebrew:

```
brew install wa-lang/tap/wa
```

### 1.1.4 Scoop (Windows)

For Windows systems, it can also be installed through Scoop:

```
scoop bucket add wa-lang https://github.com/wa-lang/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install wa-lang/wa
```

### 1.1.5 local Playground 

After the Wa-lang compiler is successfully installed, enter `wa play` on the command line to open the local playground. The program will open the browser page by default, or you can enter the [http://localhost:2023/](http://localhost:2023/) address to access. The effect is as follows:
