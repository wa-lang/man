## 3.3. Floating point number

Wa-lang currently supports the following types of floating point numbers (both are IEEE 754 standards):

- `f32`: 32-bit floating point number
- `f64`: 64-bit floating point number

Floating point numbers support the following unary operators

- `-`: Get the negative arithmetic value (that is, subtract the operand from 0)

For example：
```wa
    i: f32 = 1.25
    println(-i) //-1.25
```

Floating point numbers support the following binary arithmetic operations:
- `+`: Add, the two operand types must be consistent, the type of return value is same with operands;
- `-`: Minus, the two operand types must be consistent, the type of return value is same with operands;
- `*`: Mul, the two operand types must be consistent, the type of return value is same with operands;
- `/`: Div, the two operand types must be consistent, the type of return value is same with operands;

For example：
```wa
    i, j: f64 = 1, 0.5
    println(i + j) // 1.5
    println(i - j) // 0.5
    println(i * j) // 0.5
    println(j / i) // 2
```

Floating point numbers support the following comparison operations:
- `==`: equal. The operands types must be consistent, and the return value is of `bool` type. If the judgment condition is met, `true` will be returned, otherwise `false` will be returned, the same below;
- `!=`: not equal;
- `>`: greater than;
- `>=`: greater than;
- `<`: less than;
- `<=`: Small equal to.

When using untyped floating-point constants for variable short-declaration, the variable type is `f64`. The following two ways of writing are equivalent:

```wa
    f := 1.5
```

```wa
    f: f64 = 1.5
```
